# RandomGame
This is a little project I wrote in five minutes because I was bored.
Sorry if my code is slobby, I'm still learning.
You need [Python3.6](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.0/python-3.6.0.exe) to run this script.
[Click here to open the script in your browser.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lorddarky/RandomGame/master/randomgame.py)
Now right-click and save as randomgame.py
After downloading create a games.txt and put it in the same folder as the randomgame.py.
Now enter the paths of your games like this:
##Please use this format:
C:\example\example\game1.exe,C:\example1\example\game2.exe
##Example:
E:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Kerbal Space Program\Launcher.exe,E:\Riot Games\League of Legends\lol.launcher.exe
