# RandomGame
This is a little project I wrote in five minutes because I was bored.
Sorry if my code is slobby, I'm still learning.
To run this create a games.txt in the same
folder and put the paths of your games in there.
##Please use this format:
C:\example\example\game1.exe,C:\example1\example\game2.exe
##Example:
E:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Kerbal Space Program\Launcher.exe,E:\Riot Games\League of Legends\lol.launcher.exe
